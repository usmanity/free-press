A minimal and legible Wordpress theme

## Status
After starting with underscores, I realized I was bring in too much boilerplate and I was spending more time removing unneeded things from the code than actually working on the theme. 
So now, I am actually starting from scratch and reading through the Wordpress Codex to develop this theme. 

## Goals
This theme is focused on removing extraneous visual elements and getting to the bare minimum and still being able to look like a great theme.

- Use easy to read colors
- Be responsive without being two different themes
- Remove UI that's unnecessary

*These goals might change as I move forward but right now they're good to navigate by*

## Versioning
There will be no version until I have a working version of the theme ready.
