==========

A minimal and legible Wordpress theme

## Goals
This theme is focused on removing extraneous visual elements and getting to the bare minimum and still being able to look like a great theme.

- Use easy to read colors
- Be responsive without being two different themes
- Remove UI that's unnecessary

*These goals might change as I move forward but right now they're good to navigate by*
